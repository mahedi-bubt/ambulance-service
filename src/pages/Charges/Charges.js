                    What Is Minimum Assurance Km Covered?
                    Minimum Assurance KM covered is the minimum charge which the ambulance service provider would charge. The confirmed rates are the minimum charges for which the ambulance service provider would cover minimum km (varies as per the type of ambulance) and over and above the minimum km the PER KM Rates would be applicable as provided above.
                    <br />
                    What Is Ambulance Rate Per KM?
                    The ambulance rate per km is the rate that would be charged over and above the minimum km. Please refer to the below example to understand the calculation of the charges:
                    <br />
                    Example - If the patient family chooses Basic ambulance service and cover a 12km then the charges would be calculated are as follow:
                    <br />
                    Minimum charges = 500 (for first 10 km)
                    <br />
                    Additional charges Next 2 km @ Rs 30 = 60
                    <br />
                    Even if the ambulance covers less than 10km then the charges would be Rs. 500.
                    <br />
                    What is the waiting rate per hour?
                    It is the charges when the ambulance had to wait until the patient is on boarded and starts the vehicle towards the hospital. The waiting charges would vary depending on the type of ambulance service which is mentioned in our rate chart.</p>
